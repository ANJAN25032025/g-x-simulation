 The square-and-multiply algorithm is a widely used technique for efficient exponentiation,
 especially in cryptographic applications. While the algorithm offers a general-purpose solution
 with logarithmic time complexity, certain classes of exponents allow for further optimization,
 leading to a reduced number of computational steps. This project investigates such special
 classes of exponents, focusing on their structure and properties that permit fewer operations
 than the standard square-and-multiply approach. The study aims to characterize these classes,
 provide theoretical justification for the step reduction, and demonstrate practical examples
 where significant computational savings are achieved
